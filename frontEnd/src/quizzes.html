                    <p>
                        SQL Injection is a web security vulnerability that allows 
                        attackers to manipulate a websiteâ€™s database 
                        by injecting malicious SQL queries through 
                        user input fields. This can lead to unauthorized
                        data access, modification, or deletion.
                        For instance, attackers could retrieve sensitive data such as usernames,
                        passwords, or credit card information. Proper input validation, 
                        parameterized queries, and prepared statements are key defenses 
                        against SQL Injection.

            <!-- Buffer Overflow content -->
            <div class="contentBox" id="bufferContent">
                <h1>Buffer Overflow</h1>
                <p>
                    A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a memory buffer than it can hold, 
                    causing adjacent memory to be overwritten. This vulnerability is often exploited by attackers to execute malicious code, 
                    crash the system, or gain unauthorized access. Buffer overflows are commonly caused by poorly written code 
                    that does not check input lengths. Preventive measures include using secure coding practices,
                    bounds checking, and modern tools like address space layout randomization (ASLR).

            <!-- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) content -->
            <div class="contentBox" id="xssContent">
                <h1>Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</h1>
                <p>
                    Cross-Site Scripting is a vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. 
                    This typically occurs when a website fails to sanitize user input. 
                    The malicious scripts can steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, impersonating the victim. 
                    XSS can be prevented by escaping or sanitizing input, employing Content Security Policy (CSP), 
                    and validating all user-provided data.
